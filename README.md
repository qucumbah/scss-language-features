# Language Features for SCSS

This is a fork of VS Code's built-in [CSS Language features](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/extensions/css-language-features/) extension (excluding the experimental drop or paste features) with some additional SCSS-specific features added based on [vscode-scss](https://github.com/mrmlnc/vscode-scss) extension.
